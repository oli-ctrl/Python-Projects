# Welcome to Python Projects!

This is the repo I use for storing any small tests/ peices that I make in python. Feel Free to have a look around!

# Files
Its Mostly self explanatory there are a few games in `Python\Games` Most of the repo is done in python as thats the majority of my course
- Many of the python projects require tkinter 
- The `HTML` folder is mostly empty or incomplete as I have not done much with that. 

# Other
- Please read the commits to see my multiple journeys into insanity
- I likely wont accept any pr's to this repo but if you have any reccomendations/critisisms (as long as its useful) of my code please raise it in the issues [here](https://github.com/oli-ctrl/School-Stuffs/issues)
